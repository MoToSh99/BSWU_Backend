Here's a first lil working test of the in-game stock market. Currently all the prices just change randomly after every action. And it's evident there's actually not enough info to make sound decisions.

@DingDongVG that's fair. Though I was imagining Steam, where it's all accumulated into a neat little "it's good/it's bad" score.

Tho they separate recent reviews and overall reviews, so it might not have a huge effect. Unless it changes how it get's recommended

@DingDongVG possibly. But what if a shitton of people just hated you for some reason, and decided to review bomb your game? Not even mentioning the game

@5HaUNaTH1N @BernieSanders In my opinion, I think if small business aren't able to handle a tiny wage increase, they probably weren't that profitable a business in the first place. I mean if they only have 10 employees tops. And 100$ extra an hour makes them break, they'd probably break regardless
************
@5HaUNaTH1N @BernieSanders i think the reality is that Mcdonalds actually has an insanely huge profit, because they're underpaying their workers, and could live off fine with a wage increase. Only thing stopping them is greed.

That's why higher wages by law would be good

@ikesCG it's scary to start alone. But if you through it, and is sociable with people around you, they'll be nice and help you if you ask them. Form is the easiest thing to get help with. Also start with the lowest possible weights
************
20kg for a person with barely any muscles is literally the same amount of effort as like 80kg for a really buff person. 

Muscles literally have a set limit, and you need to slowly develop and push them to take more
************
@ikesCG I only started going to the gym cause a buff guy at my work encouraged me and taught me
************
@fentanylchic @HerculeanStren1 @OpticsPolice it's cause it's literally the same amount of effort. 1 kg for a scrawny person can literally be as difficult as 60 for a buff guy. Your muscles need time to adjust

************
whilst i was never a fan of CallMeCarsons content, and sexting and sending nudes to someone that's young is obiously bad and they should have known better. Dating someone 2 years younger than you. Is not comparable to fucking Epstein, these memes are kinda sick to me

I was just trying to learn some fucking basic math, and then my soul get's sucked out of my body https://t.co/rvuvN4SokS
************
Let's think about the fact that the obnoxious youtuber recording himself giving money to homeless people, probably gave more money to homeless people than the people complaining about the fact he only did it for views
************
Making a video about how some youtuber is actually a pedophile and is horrible. And earning some money off the video. Is just as bad as
selling wheelchairs to people who lost their legs in an unfortunate way.

They both do a good thing, and get compensated for it
************
From a different perspective. News-stations and journalists often get payed by governments or bought out by big companies. Even if this is small, and controversial the idea of getting add money straight from the viewer seems like the best solution to me??
************
Just seems to me, whenever people are like, THEY PUT ADS ON THE VIDEO, or YOU'RE USING THE VICTIMS.
That inadvertently makes it so people get dissuaded from bringing attention to huge actual problems and shitty people
************
Like if i make a big expose video about how Jon hit Arin's girlfriend at magfest (and it was actually real and well documented) Shouldn't i be able to earn the 6 dollars, for putting in the effort to research the subject and let the world know?
************
I think it's dumb, everytime someone makes a well documented youtube video/essay kinda deal about a touchy subject, like a famous youtuber being really horrible.  People demand the ads are taken off. Like shouldn't people be allowed to get compensated for brining light to it?

The plot looses it's focus after this sadly, turns into a mess of bad videogame driving kinda, and being surrounded by a bunch of bad men, while she's holding a nail gun. But waking up i get the melancholy
************
There was a ruckus and cars approaching in the distance. I leaned in for a kiss and she responded in kind, and then she dragged us away. 
We went on a motorcycle. And tried escaping. Her using her alien like powers for aid, me with a gun, felt like i wouldn't let anyone take her
************
Our eyes locked and we had known eachother prior before this moment, but now it clicked. I think i was in love with her behind my joking demeanor, and she felt the same. In every past instance when my friend tried talking she had ran off, not now. Though we weren't safe
************
I got it she was from some kinda school. "Like xavier? From x-men" i asked jokingly. "Yeah yeah" she responded like this everytime I asked something she couldn't answer, she wasn't from x-men. Don't know where. Maybe she was an alien or an experiment, no idea, but she was pretty
************
I had a very intricate dream, where i found a girl who had fire superpowers. When I saw her again she was playing with matches, when i asked she said using her own powers drains her. I had relived that same moment multiple times but with my friend doing the talking. Not this time

@damndaamiaan @LilithLovett Aight fair fair. I didn't think there was too. It's just it's prevelance makes people wonder and potentially even more confusing.

@damndaamiaan @LilithLovett I know atleast one person that took hormones and all that but realized halfway through they weren't actually trans for those reasons for example.

If someone is 90 percent sure they are  (and is adult) they should of course go for it though.
************
@damndaamiaan @LilithLovett I've heard from some friends a lot of people will call other people "eggs" because they are the least bit uncertain, this is probably hopefully a minority.

What i mean tho, is when it's suddenly such a prevelant topic, some people can't help but wonder. even if they shouldn't

@TaartFart you can do whatever you want. But i think it's a much easier approach, to sculpt your whole model first. So you get all the proportions good and nice. Without worrying about verts and faces and shit. And then doing the vertex shit on top of the sculpt.

 how i made this fucker https://t.co/TobwuGSwyO

@TaartFart Sculpt first. Then verticy madness second

@TaartFart is that what that means?!?!?
That's braindead, i already thought saying

she/her
was kinda silly when you can just say guy, or girl.

But this just makes it even more confusing
************

Just have nothing and people will call you whatever anyway

@travis_dragon00 I think it's gross, but when it's a purple cartoon dragon, i think it's separated enough from reality. The freaks can have their fat spyros to themselves, i don't needa look

Main problem with Spelunky games for me, is that 50% of the game is spent on the first level

As i arrive back from the toilet stalls to the office after 2 hours, and my boss asks what i've doing all that time, i pull a smile as i ask "You sure you wanna know (;  "

Flexing my muscles in the bathroom mirror for half an hour while my unflushed shit ferments in the toilet bowl

@RoseTheVixen @dvntownsend that's not very nice ):

@IGN so following the article it's all about the Amber Herd abuse story, but if the recent leak of the full video and whatnot is taken into account, then i'm pretty sure Amber herd is full of shit. So that all around sucks

I gots serious hots for someone, but like they had a really horrible past relationship so I think they're kinda anxious about any more. Imagine someone being so fucked you become afraid of being together with another person, that's so horrible üòü

@tv2politik @tv2newsdk Er det for dramatisk en holdning ikke at synes om mink avling til at starte med? M√•ske er det hypokritisk, men grise og k√∏ger bliver i det mindste spist, mink, giver dyrre pels frakker

@RickyTi17383323 the *bad* is that the person made this for their own sexual pleasure, and that my character was involved. They have the right, but it's still a shame
